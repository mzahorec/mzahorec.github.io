Here are some brief descriptions and links. If you are working on a similar probject and want to collaborate, please feel free to reach out to me for more information!

## Anscombe Search
Check out our tool for searching the published works of G.E.M. Anscombe: [https://anscombesearch.collegiuminstitute.org/](https://anscombesearch.collegiuminstitute.org/). Built using Elasticsearch. Work funded by the [Collegium Institute](https://collegiuminstitute.org/). 

## Tetens NEH Project
I am leading the efforts to digitize German versions of the philosophical works, broadly construed, of Johann Nicolaus Tetens (1736-1807). This work follows Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines. See here for Python XML(TEI)-generator: [https://github.com/mzahorec/tetens](https://github.com/mzahorec/tetens). This work is in coordination with a new print translation of these philosophical works. For more details: [https://tetensproject.create.fsu.edu/](https://tetensproject.create.fsu.edu/). 

## Corpus Analysis for Experimental Philosophy
In [this paper](http://127.0.0.1:4000/research/#linguistic-corpora-and-ordinary-language-on-the-dispute-between-ryle-and-austin-about-the-use-of-voluntary-involuntary-voluntarily-and-involuntarily), we developed and deployed new methods in experimental philosophy, which involved analyzing and aggregating linguistic judgments across a wide range of language data, drawn from the [British National Corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/). See the paper for our approach, motivation, and potential extensions of this work.

## Language Model Evaluation at Humana
During Summer 2024, I worked full-time at Humana with the [Responsible AI Team](https://mostly.ai/data-democratization-podcast/fair-synthetic-data-and-ethical-ai-in-healthcare). We leveraged existing frameworks and collections of methods (e.g., [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/) and [TrustLLM](https://trustllm.eu/)) to improve LLM evaluation processes at Humana in an empirically-informed, principled manner. Primarily concerned with Summarization and Question-Answer tasks.

## Data Science at MathWorks
For three summers (2020-2022), I worked full-time at MathWorks with the Data Science Courses Team. I helped develop scripts, projects, assessments, and more. See, e.g., [Practical Data Science with MATLAB on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science-matlab). 

## Formatting and Index Generator--Kant's *Critique of Practical Reason*
For Courtney Fugate's new translation of Kant's Second Critique. In addition to formatting the book in InDesign, I wrote Python code to parse the raw text and generate an index. It implements various replacement rules and rules for term-searching. Feel free to peruse: [https://github.com/mzahorec/indexgen](https://github.com/mzahorec/indexgen).
