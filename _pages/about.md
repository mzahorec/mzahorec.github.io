Hello!

I'm Mike Zahorec--a philosopher and computer scientist.

My research focuses on our concepts and classifications—from [AI methods](/research/#understanding-ai) to the [objects of scientific theories](/research/#natural-kinds-towards-a-revised-picture) to [ordinary language](/research/#linguistic-corpora-and-ordinary-language-on-the-dispute-between-ryle-and-austin-about-the-use-of-voluntary-involuntary-voluntarily-and-involuntarily). I am interested, in a word, in what exists and how we think about it.

In my philosophy dissertation, I work this topic from a very general angle by engaging with the philosophy of science literature on kinds. I defend what I call *pluralist realism*. [This short paper](/research/#kinds-are-what-there-isand-how-we-think-of-it) and [this longer paper](/research/#natural-kinds-towards-a-revised-picture) are from my dissertation.

I work on the ethics and theory of AI, focusing on epistemic issues. From various [theoretical](/research/#understanding-ai) and [normative](/research/#getting-clear-about-opacity-a-variety-of-terminologies-and-their-significance-in-the-era-of-generative-ai) angles, I have been working out our epistemic relationships to different AI systems, especially when understood with different explainablity methods. I have [developed and applied empirical methods](/research/#llm-explainability-conceptual-foundations-and-an-empirical-study-of-natural-language-explanations) for evaluating LLM self-explanations. Relatedly, I wrote a short paper about a [responsible use paradigm](/research/#a-paradigm-for-responsible-ai-use) for LLMs.

I am interested in AI evaluation more generally. Beyond being theoretically and technically very *interesting*, it is *normatively* significant for relatively obvious reasons: whether and in what contexts we should use or rely on systems depends, in large part, on how well they perform in relevant contexts. I have done [relevant industry work](/cv/) and [academic research](/research/#llm-explainability-conceptual-foundations-and-an-empirical-study-of-natural-language-explanations).

I am a proponent and practitioner of digital humanities. See some of my [projects](/projects/).
